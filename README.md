This is a small portion of the coureswork I have completed and one independent project being the housing data kaggle competition in which I scored top 12% on my first attempt.  The tableaus were made on crash data to answer questions under a time restriction to be efficient.  The SQL is fully functional and useable for a business.  The python notebook on the engine sensors was used to generate a report and the goal was to predict the RUL (Remaining Useful Lifespan).
